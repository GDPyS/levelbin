# levelbin
An attempt to implement Geometry Dash level storage as a binary format.

## Why?
Geometry Dash levels use quite an inefficient storage format when written to disk. This can cause issues on large Geometry Dash server deployments where storage
is a limited resource. Our solution to this is the usage of a binary storage format, the peak of storage efficiency!
